Problem 5:
Algorithm is the same as when you want to tie your shoe correctly and not get trip
over. Everytime you need to follow exactly the same series of moves. For example...
4 Steps: cross, loop, fold and pull
Following the same prodecure will always produce the same result and provide the
same solution everytime
